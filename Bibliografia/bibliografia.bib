	abstract = {In this paper, an infinite-horizon adaptive linear quadratic tracking (ALQT) control scheme is designed for optimal attitude tracking of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed control scheme is experimentally validated in the presence of real-world uncertainties in quadrotor system parameters and sensor measurement. The designed control scheme guarantees asymptotic stability of the close-loop system with the help of complete controllability of the attitude dynamics in applying optimal control signals. To achieve robustness against parametric uncertainties, the optimal tracking solution is combined with an online least squares based parameter identification scheme to estimate the instantaneous inertia of the quadrotor. Sensor measurement noises are also taken into account for the on-board Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. To improve controller performance in the presence of sensor measurement noises, two sensor fusion techniques are employed, one based on Kalman filtering and the other based on complementary filtering. The ALQT controller performance is compared for the use of these two sensor fusion techniques, and it is concluded that the Kalman filter based approach provides less mean-square estimation error, better attitude estimation, and better attitude control performance.},

Hence, there has also been a growth in the number of control algorithms to service many applications embodied by these vehicles. Initially, UASs were made popular by the military for reconnaissance, intelligence, surveillance, and target acquisition (RISTA) applications. Nowadays, UASs are used for everything from crop surveys to tourism. Nowhere is this more evident than with a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This paper presents a survey of control methods for multi-rotor systems, namely quadrotors. In doing so, we hope to visualize a clear path to what additional capabilities might be needed in the future. In our examination, we review many of the notable research organizations and their efforts to expand the utility of multi-rotor aircraft. We also summarize the basic literature definitions and control strategies for autonomous quadrotors.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the reference flight trajectory generation and planning problems for quadcopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The reference flight trajectory is defined as the composition of path and motion functions. Both of them are generated by using quintic B-spline functions. Based on differential flatness approach, the quadcopter dynamical constraints are satisfied instantaneously by computing the induced aerodynamical moments and lift force. The optimal reference flight trajectory, with respect to the mission requirements and imposed constraints, is reached by manipulating the control points‚Äô vectors of B-spline functions via a nonlinear constrained optimization method. The mission requirements are defined as a set of waypoints with their respective scheduled flight timetable. A minimum-energy cost function is developed to minimize the consumed energy and induced efforts by reference flight trajectory. For the need of the optimal overfly-times schedule, the overfly times with respect to the defined constraints and performance criteria are calculated. Numerical simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method.},

The purpose of path planning, unlike motion planning which must be taken into consideration of dynamics, is to find a kinematically optimal path with the least time as well as model the environment completely. We discuss the fundamentals of these most successful robot 3D path planning algorithms which have been developed in recent years and concentrate on universally applicable algorithms which can be implemented in aerial robots, ground robots, and underwater robots. This paper classifies all the methods into five categories based on their exploring mechanisms and proposes a category, called multifusion based algorithms. For all these algorithms, they are analyzed from a time efficiency and implementable area perspective. Furthermore a comprehensive applicable analysis for each kind of method is presented after considering their merits and weaknesses.},

A model reduction technique associated with the dynamics of an unmanned quadrotor helicopter is also put forward so as to minimize the burden of calculations in application of MPC into an airborne platform. For three-dimensional tracking control of the quadrotor helicopter, simulation results corresponding to the algebraic formulation‚Äîpresented in this paper‚Äîversus the standard MPC formulation commonly found in the literature further illustrate effectiveness of this study. Unsuccessful implementation of the standard formulation on the testbed due to computational burden proves the necessity and advantages of this new approach. Eventually, to demonstrate effectiveness of the developed MPC algorithm, the suggested algebraic-based MPC framework is successfully implemented on an unmanned quadrotor helicopter testbed (known as Qball-X4) available at the Networked Autonomous Vehicles Lab (NAVL) of Concordia University for tracking control of the unmanned aerial vehicle.},

	abstract = {In the current study, an adaptive PID controller is proposed for fault-tolerant control of a quadrotor helicopter system in the presence of actuator faults. A fuzzy inference scheme is used to tune in real-time the controller gains. Tracking errors and change in tracking errors are used in this fuzzy scheduler to make the system act faster and more effectively in the event of fault occurrence. Two fault scenarios are investigated: the loss of control effectiveness in all actuators and the loss of control effectiveness in one single actuator. The proposed adaptive PID controller is compared with the conventional one through an experimental application to a quadrotor helicopter testbed at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering of Concordia University. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this article we extend the Voronoi-Delaunay analysis to packings of nonspherical convex objects. Main properties of the Voronoi network, which are known for systems of spheres, are valid for systems of any convex objects. A general numerical algorithm for calculation of the Voronoi network in three dimensions is proposed. It is based on the calculation of the trajectory of the imaginary empty sphere of variable size, moving inside a system (the Delaunay empty sphere method). Analysis of voids is presented for an ensemble of random straight lines and for a molecular dynamics model of liquid crystal. The spatial distribution of voids and a simple percolation analysis are obtained. The distributions of the bottleneck radii and the radii of spheres inscribed in the voids are calculated.},

Complete information about a freespace and goal is encoded in the form of a special artificial potential function, called a navigation function, that connects the kinematic planning problem with the dynamic execution problem in a provably correct fashion. The navigation function automatically gives rise to a bounded-torque feedback controller for the robot's actuators that guarantees collision-free motion and convergence to the destination from almost all initial free configurations. A formula for navigation functions that guide a point-mass robot in a generalized sphere world is developed. The simplest member of this family is a space obtained by puncturing a disk by an arbitrary number of smaller disjoint disks representing obstacles. The other spaces are obtained from this model by a suitable coordinate transformation. Simulation results for planar scenarios are provided.< >},

	abstract = {The task of planning trajectories for a mobile robot has received considerable attention in the research literature. Most of the work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move; less attention has been paid to the problem of partially known environments. This situation occurs for an exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the benefit of a floorplan or terrain map. Existing approaches plan an initial path based on known information and then modify the plan locally or replan the entire path as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors, sacrificing optimality or computational efficiency respectively. This paper introduces a new algorithm, D*, capable of planning paths in unknown, partially known, and changing environments in an efficient, optimal, and complete manner.< >},

This framework allows for multiple actuation modes, diverse trajectory-planning objectives, and varying levels of autonomy. The vehicle navigation problem is formulated as a constrained optimal control problem with constraints bounding a navigable region of the road surface. A model predictive controller iteratively plans the best-case vehicle trajectory through this constrained corridor. The framework then uses this trajectory to assess the threat posed to the vehicle and intervenes in proportion to this threat. This approach minimizes controller intervention while ensuring that the vehicle does not depart from a navigable corridor of travel. Simulated results are presented here to demonstrate the framework's ability to incorporate multiple threat thresholds and configurable intervention laws while sharing control with a human driver.},

The fractional differentiation operator used in the FOCP is approximated using Oustaloup‚Äôs approximation into a state-space realization form. The original problem is then reformulated to fit the definition used in general-purpose optimal control problem (OCP) solvers such as RIOTS_95, a solver created as a Matlab toolbox. Illustrative examples from the literature are reproduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and a free final time OCP is also solved.},

We demonstrate that the parameter-optimization formulation of the problem is numerically ill-conditioned, and that it is therefore essential to include analytic, or exact, gradients of the objective fiunction and the constraints in order to guarantee a solution. A recursive expression for these gradients is developed for general serial chains. Constraints on end-effector motions are taken into account using the logarithmn of the spatial displacement. Our formulation relies on the use of matrix exponentials for the manipulator kinematics, dynamics, and task constraints. Several examples are presented that demostrate the power and flexibility of our approach.},
