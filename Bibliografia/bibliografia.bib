	abstract = {In this paper, an infinite-horizon adaptive linear quadratic tracking (ALQT) control scheme is designed for optimal attitude tracking of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed control scheme is experimentally validated in the presence of real-world uncertainties in quadrotor system parameters and sensor measurement. The designed control scheme guarantees asymptotic stability of the close-loop system with the help of complete controllability of the attitude dynamics in applying optimal control signals. To achieve robustness against parametric uncertainties, the optimal tracking solution is combined with an online least squares based parameter identification scheme to estimate the instantaneous inertia of the quadrotor. Sensor measurement noises are also taken into account for the on-board Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. To improve controller performance in the presence of sensor measurement noises, two sensor fusion techniques are employed, one based on Kalman filtering and the other based on complementary filtering. The ALQT controller performance is compared for the use of these two sensor fusion techniques, and it is concluded that the Kalman filter based approach provides less mean-square estimation error, better attitude estimation, and better attitude control performance.},

	abstract = {Over the past several decades, there has been a constant increase in the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs). Hence, there has also been a growth in the number of control algorithms to service many applications embodied by these vehicles. Initially, UASs were made popular by the military for reconnaissance, intelligence, surveillance, and target acquisition (RISTA) applications. Nowadays, UASs are used for everything from crop surveys to tourism. Nowhere is this more evident than with a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This paper presents a survey of control methods for multi-rotor systems, namely quadrotors. In doing so, we hope to visualize a clear path to what additional capabilities might be needed in the future. In our examination, we review many of the notable research organizations and their efforts to expand the utility of multi-rotor aircraft. We also summarize the basic literature definitions and control strategies for autonomous quadrotors.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the reference flight trajectory generation and planning problems for quadcopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The reference flight trajectory is defined as the composition of path and motion functions. Both of them are generated by using quintic B-spline functions. Based on differential flatness approach, the quadcopter dynamical constraints are satisfied instantaneously by computing the induced aerodynamical moments and lift force. The optimal reference flight trajectory, with respect to the mission requirements and imposed constraints, is reached by manipulating the control points’ vectors of B-spline functions via a nonlinear constrained optimization method. The mission requirements are defined as a set of waypoints with their respective scheduled flight timetable. A minimum-energy cost function is developed to minimize the consumed energy and induced efforts by reference flight trajectory. For the need of the optimal overfly-times schedule, the overfly times with respect to the defined constraints and performance criteria are calculated. Numerical simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method.},

The purpose of path planning, unlike motion planning which must be taken into consideration of dynamics, is to find a kinematically optimal path with the least time as well as model the environment completely. We discuss the fundamentals of these most successful robot 3D path planning algorithms which have been developed in recent years and concentrate on universally applicable algorithms which can be implemented in aerial robots, ground robots, and underwater robots. This paper classifies all the methods into five categories based on their exploring mechanisms and proposes a category, called multifusion based algorithms. For all these algorithms, they are analyzed from a time efficiency and implementable area perspective. Furthermore a comprehensive applicable analysis for each kind of method is presented after considering their merits and weaknesses.},

A model reduction technique associated with the dynamics of an unmanned quadrotor helicopter is also put forward so as to minimize the burden of calculations in application of MPC into an airborne platform. For three-dimensional tracking control of the quadrotor helicopter, simulation results corresponding to the algebraic formulation—presented in this paper—versus the standard MPC formulation commonly found in the literature further illustrate effectiveness of this study. Unsuccessful implementation of the standard formulation on the testbed due to computational burden proves the necessity and advantages of this new approach. Eventually, to demonstrate effectiveness of the developed MPC algorithm, the suggested algebraic-based MPC framework is successfully implemented on an unmanned quadrotor helicopter testbed (known as Qball-X4) available at the Networked Autonomous Vehicles Lab (NAVL) of Concordia University for tracking control of the unmanned aerial vehicle.},
